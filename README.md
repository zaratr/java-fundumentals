# Labs for solving basic DataStructures.
[Lab one  - Pluralize/Clock/FlipHeads](lab1/Main.java)
- this has three functions that adds 's' to string , returns time, and determines if heads
****
[Lab two - Average/AverageAll/ContainsDuplicates/Roll](basiclibrary/lib/src/main/java/basiclibrary/Library.java)
- this has four functions: averages an array; searches an 2D array and finds an array with the least average; finds if array has a duplicate; rolls a random dice 1-6  and creates an array of numbers rolled.
****
[Lab 06 - Inheritence Theater/ Shop](inheritance/lib/src/main/java/inheritance)
- Added a simple use a relationship in code. waiting for more instructions on classes but review uses a restaurant and vice versa.

[Lab 07 - Inheritence Theater/ Shop](inheritance/lib/src/main/java/inheritance)
- Added inheritence and Abstraction to Lab. uses no Generics or interface but has dynamic casting.
- by starting at the LibraryTest, One can look inside the main/java/inheritence and find the flow for program.
- since this was a funky containing assignment rather than inheritence, I was more focused on using a containing/compostion relationship.
- still, there is some inheritence involved. Event is the Abstract class and its children are Movie, REstaurant , shop.
